netcliparsers - Parser library for screen scraping CLI output from network devices
==================================================================================

This will become a library of parsers based on `pyparsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_ for parsing screen scraped CLI text output from network devices.


Usage Examples
--------------

soon (tm)


Windows
-------

If you run the setup on Windows you'll need to have git installed. Pbr tries to figure out the version number via git. I'll need to fix this "soon".


Feedback
--------

Bug reports, patches and ideas are welcome.

Just send me an e-mail (jochenbartl@mailbox.org) or open an issue on GitHub
